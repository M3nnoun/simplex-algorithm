# Simplex Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Simplex algorithm, a widely used technique to solve linear programming (LP) problems. LP problems involve maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. The Simplex algorithm iteratively navigates through the feasible region of the problem, finding solutions that improve the objective function until the optimal solution is reached.

## Key Features

- **Supports standard LP problems**: Formulates and solves LP problems with:
  - Linear objective function
  - Linear equality and inequality constraints
  - Non-negative variables
- **Efficient implementation**: Leverages efficient data structures and algorithms to handle various problem sizes effectively.
- **Clear and concise code**: Adheres to best practices for code readability and maintainability through proper commenting and documentation.
- **Detailed explanations**: Provides comments within the code to elucidate the algorithm's logic and steps.

## Usage

Include instructions on how to use the Simplex algorithm implementation, including installation steps, example usage, and any dependencies required.
